                Hi! Please allow me to introduce myself, my name is Adrienne Cordell and I am a student at the University of Wisconsin.  I am 22 years-old and I am from seattle. I started my coding journey in August of 2022. For a long time it has been a dream of mine to be a web developer and I am so excited to be on ths journey.
